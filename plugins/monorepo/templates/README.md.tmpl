## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, make sure you have met the following requirements:

- **Docker**: Docker and Docker Compose are required to run the application locally. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

### Running the application locally

To run the application locally, just run 

1. **Start Docker containers:**

   Make sure Docker is running on your machine and then execute:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Access the application:**

   Once the containers are up, the frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.

   To log in to the application, go to the /login page and use the following credentials:

	-	Email: `admin@admin.com`
	-	Password: `Admin@123!`

3. **Shutting down the containers:**

   To stop the application and remove the containers, use:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
